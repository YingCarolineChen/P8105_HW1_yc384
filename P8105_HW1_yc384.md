# **P8105 DSI Homework 1**

## Problem 0.1: Use R Markdown to write reproducible reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize your work.

  - Created a public GitHub repo and a local R Project both named
    P8105\_HW1\_yc384
  - Created a single .Rmd file: P8105\_HW1\_yc384.Rmd
  - My link to homework1 repo is:
    <https://github.com/YingCarolineChen/P8105_HW1_yc384.git>

## Problem 0.2: Code styling: pay attention the the points listed below

  - Meaningful variable / object names
  - Readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and
    indentation; etc)
  - Clearly-written text to explain code and results
  - A lack of superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no
    extra library calls;
ect)

## Problem 1: Understand variable types in R: numeric, character, and factor variables:

### 1\. First code chunk: This chunk Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 8
  - a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
# Create a dataframe 
hw1_df = tibble(
#a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
norm_samp = rnorm (8, mean = 0, sd = 1),
# Logic vector: if elements of the random sample are positive
norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
# Character vector of length 8
vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "abc", "ad", "ac", "bc", " "),
# Factor vector of length 8 with 3 differesnt levels
vec_factor = factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low")),

)

# Take the mean of each variable
# Examing the mean of varible norm_samp: 
mean(hw1_df$norm_samp)
```

    ## [1] -0.04375177

``` r
# Examing the mean of varible norm_samp_pos: 
mean(hw1_df$norm_samp_pos)
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
# Examing the mean of varible var_char: 
mean(hw1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(hw1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# xaming the mean of varible var_factor: 
mean(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(hw1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

  - **From results above, we can see that the ransom normal sample and
    the logic vector had their mean calculated. But the character
    variable and the factor variable did not have the mean calculated.**

### 2\. Second code chunk:

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result
  - convert logical vector to factor & then convert result to numeric &
    multiply the random sample by the result
